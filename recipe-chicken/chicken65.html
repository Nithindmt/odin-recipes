    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Other stories are downright bizarre: the chicken is marinated for 65 days; it is made from 65-day-old chickens; a chicken is cut into 65 pieces; a chef once added 65 chillies to the recipe to make it super spicy and so forth. In reality, the dish was introduced in 1965 by Buhari's hotel and hence the name</p>
