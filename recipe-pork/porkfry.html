    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Meat cooked in spices is so popular among Christians in Kerala; it has become pretty much a part of tradition for many locals. Buying fresh meat straight from the butcher and prepping it with care is a Sunday ritual enjoyed in almost every home across the state.</p>
    <p>This Kerala pork fry recipe (pork ularthiyathu) provides very tender pieces of pork perfectly cooked in spices. As with the type of pork, I always go for cuts minus the fat. No excuses. The trimmed cuts give a slight crispiness to the meat during the final stir frying stage.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork</li>
            <li>Onion</li>

            <li>Garlic</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with cooking pork in the pressure cooker</li>
        <li>Place pork along with onions, green chilies, turmeric, coriander, garam masala, black pepper, ginger, garlic, white vinegar, curry leaves and salt in a pressure cooker.</li>

    </ol>
